# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

A Machine Learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression. This project uses publicly available datasets: `fraudTrain.csv` and `fraudTest.csv`.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- `fraudTrain.csv` – Training data with labeled fraud transactions.
- `fraudTest.csv` – Testing data to evaluate model performance.

These files should be downloaded from [Kaggle – Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection) and placed in the project directory.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- One-hot encoding for categorical features
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
- Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
